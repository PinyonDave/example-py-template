# Intermediate Data

This folder contains intermediate data that has been cleaned. This data has been cleaned so that it is ready to be prepared for modeling. Missing values have been standardized, columns have been renamed, and data types have been converted. However, it may not be ready for analysis. Data may also have been restructured to make it easier to work with. Data from different sources may have been combined and standardized to create a useable dataset.

The notebook, 02.0_data_cleaning , that was used to clean the data can be found in the notebooks folder. This notebook once finalized should be converted to a script and placed in the src/d02_processing folder. This script should be able to take raw data and clean it in the same way as the notebook and be ready for setting up for modeling.
