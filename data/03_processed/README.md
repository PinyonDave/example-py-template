# Processed data

This folder contains the processed data. This data is prepared so that it can be modeled. Outliers may be removed. Data may be filtered and sliced to meet the needs of the analysis and models. Response and predictor datatables may b e created. Training datasets maybe split into training and validation datasets. The data is ready to be fed into a model.

The notebook data_processing.ipynb contains the code that processes the intermediate data. The processed data is saved in this folder. Once the notebook has been finalized a script will be created to process the data. The script will be saved in the scripts folder.

This is tha last step in the data pipeline. The processed data is used to train the models. The models are then used to make predictions.

The data is stored in the following files:
