# Reporting Scripts

These scripts use the intermediate data, models, and model evaluation to produce the reports, tables, visualizations and maps. A final script for each report (poster, talk, paper or manuscript) should call all the appropriate scripts and store them in an approtiate data folder in the report data folder.
