# Reporting

These files contain notebooks used to evaluate and report on the data and models. They may contain figures, maps, tables or analyst interpreatations. These maybe organized into internal reports and evaluations (alpha level reporting), preliminary table and figures (manuscript beta, figures likely to go into a manuscript), specific report figures (lab talks, conference posters or talks) but will always contain a manuscript file. The manuscript file should be the current version of the manuscript figures. They can be orginally prepped in a manuscript reporting notebook but once finalized should be created into a script that can take the intermediate data, models or model outputs and create the figure and addendums for the final manuscript.

The files are listed below along with their format, and how they were produced:
