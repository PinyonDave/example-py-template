# Data acquisition

These notebooks include the process of acquiring the data from external sources or loading them from the original data source into your database of choice.

This may include python code that automates the downloading of files from public databases.

Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is date YYYYMMDD (for ordering), the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g. `20190601-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
