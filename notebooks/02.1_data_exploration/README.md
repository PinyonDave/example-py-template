These code in these notebooks may eventually be used in reporting and the final manuscript but these notebooks ar not intended to capture the process of reproting and finalizing figures and tables. They instead are meant to capture the general exploration of the data. FAFO.

Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is date YYYYMMDD (for ordering), the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g. `20190601-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
