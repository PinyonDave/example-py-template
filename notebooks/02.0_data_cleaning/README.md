# Notebooks Folder

These notebooks record the process of exploring and cleaning the data so that it is consistent and ready to be processed for analysis. This should be done in a step wise fashion so that typos and standard messy data is fixed (duplicates removed) and then the data is reshaped to meet your needs. Avoid if possible any aggregation and recoding, etc. This should become your working dataset as opposed to your raw data set.

Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is date YYYYMMDD (for ordering), the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g. `20190601-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
